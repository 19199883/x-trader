This is an XSLT stylesheet to transform Check its XML
output to HTML. It's very basic and could probably be a
lot shorter. The HTML that is output isn't very
standards compliant either, but it works.

You can generate such a report on the commandline with a quick 
 
$ xsltproc check_unittest.xslt check_output.xml > report.html
