Eclipse template for creating unit tests with check framework

The template has been tested with Eclipse Helios CDT. Note that check
framework should be installed first and the check library should be
found in system path.

Installation:

From the "New Source File" dialog, press "Configure...", then
"Import..." and select the template XML file
(e.g. check_template_eclipse_helios.xml). The template should appear
under "C Source File" tree as "C source template with check unit
testing" in "Preferences" dialog.

The newly installed template should be available when creating a "New
Source File" in "Template" combo box.
