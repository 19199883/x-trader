The `check.mk' file in this directory will improve the behaviour of
`make check' when using Automake.  If you create one test program for
each module you are testing in your program, then this will do this
following:

1) Allow tests to be compiled and run in parallel
2) Only recompile and rerun test programs when the sources change
3) Produce a .log file with the output from each test
4) Only display the contents of .log files for failed tests
5) Print either a red or green status message at the end according to
whether some tests failed or all tests passed

Modifications to your project should be minimal.  A working example
can be found in libspmt, here:

https://svn.sable.mcgill.ca/sable/spmt/libspmt/tests/

First, copy check.mk to trunk/build-aux/check.mk

Second, add the following lines to tests/Makefile.am after `TESTS' and
`check_PROGRAMS' are defined:

-----
# quiet errors re: check.mk not knowing how to create .log
.log:

LAZY_TEST_SUITE = 1
TEST_LOGS = $(TESTS:=.log)

# improved make check
include $(top_srcdir)/build-aux/check.mk
-----

Third, rebuild and test with `make check'.
