 * which entries in the queue are safe to be read.
 *
 * The producers of the queue peek at each consumer's cursor to
 * determine when it's safe to write to the queue.  (This is how we
 * protect against wrapping around within the queue's ring buffer.)
 * This means that access to the consumer's cursor must be thread-safe.
 * You must *never* access the cursor field directly; you must *always*
 * use the vrt_consumer_get_cursor and vrt_consumer_set_cursor
 * functions.
 *
 * One simplifying assumption that we have to make is that when the
 * consumer's client calls next_entry, it has completely finished with
 * all previous values.  You cannot save the value pointer to be used
 * later on, since it will almost certainly be overwritten later on by a
 * different value.  The consumer's client is responsible for extracting
 * any needed contents and stashing them into some other bit of storage
 * before retrieving the next value.
