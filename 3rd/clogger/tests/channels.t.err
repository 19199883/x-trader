Test the default (which should print out all channels).

  $ CLOG=TRACE clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]


Try limiting ourselves to one channel

  $ CLOG=TRACE CLOG_CHANNELS=main clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=TRACE CLOG_CHANNELS=libclogger clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]


Try explicitly asking for both channels.

  $ CLOG=TRACE CLOG_CHANNELS=main,libclogger clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=TRACE CLOG_CHANNELS=libclogger,main clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]


Try including channels that don't exit.

  $ CLOG=TRACE CLOG_CHANNELS=unknown clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=TRACE CLOG_CHANNELS=unknown,main clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=TRACE CLOG_CHANNELS=unknown,main,libclogger clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
