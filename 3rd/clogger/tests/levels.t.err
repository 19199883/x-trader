Test the default output (i.e., if you don't specify a log level).

  $ clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]


Test each of the log levels.

  $ CLOG=CRITICAL clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=ERROR clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=WARNING clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=NOTICE clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=INFO clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=DEBUG clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

  $ CLOG=TRACE clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

The CLOG environment variable should be case insensitive.

  $ CLOG=critical clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=error clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=warning clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=notice clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=info clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=debug clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=trace clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]


We should get an error message if the log level isn't recognized.

  $ CLOG=UNKNOWN clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
