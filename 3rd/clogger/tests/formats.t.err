Test the default format.

  $ CLOG=TRACE clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Try some custom formats.

  $ CLOG=TRACE CLOG_FORMAT="[%L] [%l]" clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=TRACE CLOG_FORMAT="%l, %c, %m" clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=TRACE CLOG_FORMAT="[%L] %m" clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=TRACE CLOG_FORMAT="logging! [%L] %m" clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]

  $ CLOG=TRACE CLOG_FORMAT="not helpful" clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
  [127]


We should get an error message for illegal formats.

  $ CLOG_FORMAT=%q clog-test
  clog-test: error while loading shared libraries: libcork.so.15: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
