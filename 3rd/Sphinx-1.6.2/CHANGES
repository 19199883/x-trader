Release 1.6.1 (released May 16, 2017)
=====================================

Dependencies
------------

1.6b1

* (updated) latex output is tested with Ubuntu trusty's texlive packages (Feb.
  2014) and earlier tex installations may not be fully compliant, particularly
  regarding Unicode engines xelatex and lualatex
* (added) latexmk is required for ``make latexpdf`` on GNU/Linux and Mac OS X
  (refs: #3082)

Incompatible changes
--------------------

1.6b1

* #1061, #2336, #3235: Now generation of autosummary doesn't contain imported
  members by default. Thanks to Luc Saffre.
* LaTeX ``\includegraphics`` command isn't overloaded: only ``\sphinxincludegraphics``
  has the custom code to fit image to available width if oversized.
* The subclasses of ``sphinx.domains.Index`` should override ``generate()``
  method.  The default implementation raises NotImplementedError
* LaTeX positioned long tables horizontally centered, and short ones
  flushed left (no text flow around table.) The position now defaults to center in
  both cases, and it will obey Docutils 0.13 ``:align:`` option (refs #3415, #3377)
* option directive also allows all punctuations for the option name (refs: #3366)
* #3413: if :rst:dir:`literalinclude`'s ``:start-after:`` is used, make ``:lines:``
  relative (refs #3412)
* ``literalinclude`` directive does not allow the combination of ``:diff:``
  option and other options (refs: #3416)
* LuaLaTeX engine uses ``fontspec`` like XeLaTeX. It is advised ``latex_engine
  = 'lualatex'`` be used only on up-to-date TeX installs (refs #3070, #3466)
* :confval:`latex_keep_old_macro_names` default value has been changed from
  ``True`` to ``False``. This means that some LaTeX macros for styling are
  by default defined only with ``\sphinx..`` prefixed names. (refs: #3429)
* Footer "Continued on next page" of LaTeX longtable's now not framed (refs: #3497)
* #3529: The arguments of ``BuildEnvironment.__init__`` is changed
* #3082: Use latexmk for pdf (and dvi) targets (Unix-like platforms only)
* #3558: Emit warnings if footnotes and citations are not referenced.  The
  warnings can be suppressed by ``suppress_warnings``.
* latex made available (non documented) colour macros from a file distributed
  with pdftex engine for Plain TeX. This is removed in order to provide better
  support for multiple TeX engines. Only interface from ``color`` or
  ``xcolor`` packages should be used by extensions of Sphinx latex writer.
  (refs #3550)
* ``Builder.env`` is not filled at instantiation
* #3594: LaTeX: single raw directive has been considered as block level element
* #3639: If ``html_experimental_html5_writer`` is available, epub builder use it by default.
* ``Sphinx.add_source_parser()`` raises an error if duplicated

1.6b2

Release 1.4 (released Mar 28, 2016)
===================================

Incompatible changes
--------------------
* Drop ``PorterStemmer`` package support. Use ``PyStemmer`` instead of ``PorterStemmer``
  to accelerate stemming.
* sphinx_rtd_theme has become optional. Please install it manually.
  Refs #2087, #2086, #1845 and #2097. Thanks to Victor Zverovich.
* #2231: Use DUrole instead of DUspan for custom roles in LaTeX writer. It enables to take
  title of roles as an argument of custom macros.
* #2022: 'Thumbs.db' and '.DS_Store' are added to `exclude_patterns` default values in
  conf.py that will be provided on sphinx-quickstart.
* #2027, #2208: The ``html_title`` accepts string values only. And The None value cannot be
  accepted.
* ``sphinx.ext.graphviz``: show graph image in inline by default
* #2060, #2224: The ``manpage`` role now generate ``sphinx.addnodes.manpage`` node instead
  of ``sphinx.addnodes.literal_emphasis`` node.
* #2022: :confval:`html_extra_path` also copies dotfiles in the extra directory, and
  refers to :confval:`exclude_patterns` to exclude extra files and directories.

  of empty
* #2251: Previously, under glossary directives, multiple terms for one definition are
  converted into single ``term`` node and the each terms in the term node are separated
  by ``termsep`` node. In new implementation, each terms are converted into individual
  ``term`` nodes and ``termsep`` node is removed.
  By this change, output layout of every builders are changed a bit.
* The default highlight language is now Python 3.  This means that source code
  is highlighted as Python 3 (which is mostly a superset of Python 2), and no
  parsing is attempted to distinguish valid code.  To get the old behavior back,
  add ``highlight_language = "python"`` to conf.py.
* `Locale Date Markup Language
  <http://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Format_Patterns>`_ like

* Add support for docutils 0.12
* Added ``sphinx.ext.napoleon`` extension for NumPy and Google style docstring
  support.
* Added support for parallel reading (parsing) of source files with the
  `sphinx-build -j` option.  Third-party extensions will need to be checked for
  compatibility and may need to be adapted if they store information in the
  build environment object.  See `env-merge-info`.
* Added the `any` role that can be used to find a cross-reference of
  *any* type in *any* domain.  Custom domains should implement the new
  `Domain.resolve_any_xref` method to make this work properly.
* Exception logs now contain the last 10 messages emitted by Sphinx.
* Added support for extension versions (a string returned by ``setup()``, these
  can be shown in the traceback log files).  Version requirements for extensions
  can be specified in projects using the new `needs_extensions` config
  value.
* Changing the default role within a document with the :dudir:`default-role`
  directive is now supported.
* PR#214: Added stemming support for 14 languages, so that the built-in document
  search can now handle these.  Thanks to Shibukawa Yoshiki.

  the order of documents before they are read by the environment.
* #1284: Program options documented with :rst:dir:`option` can now start with
  ``+``.

    supported and how the namespace declarations influence declaration and
    cross-reference lookup.

Release 1.2 beta1 (released Mar 31, 2013)
=========================================

Incompatible changes
--------------------

* Removed ``sphinx.util.compat.directive_dwim()`` and
  ``sphinx.roles.xfileref_role()`` which were deprecated since version 1.0.
* PR#122: the files given in `latex_additional_files` now override TeX
  files included by Sphinx, such as ``sphinx.sty``.
* PR#124: the node generated by `versionadded`,
  `versionchanged` and `deprecated` directives now includes
  all added markup (such as "New in version X") as child nodes, and no
  additional text must be generated by writers.
* PR#99: the :rst:dir:`seealso` directive now generates admonition nodes instead
  of the custom ``seealso`` node.

Features added
--------------

* Markup

  - The :rst:dir:`toctree` directive and the ``toctree()`` template function now
    have an ``includehidden`` option that includes hidden toctree entries (bugs
    #790 and #1047).  A bug in the ``maxdepth`` option for the ``toctree()``
    template function has been fixed (bug #1046).
  - PR#99: Strip down seealso directives to normal admonitions.  This removes
    their unusual CSS classes (admonition-see-also), inconsistent LaTeX
    admonition title ("See Also" instead of "See also"), and spurious indentation
    in the text builder.

* HTML builder

  - #783: Create a link to full size image if it is scaled with width or height.
  - #1067: Improve the ordering of the JavaScript search results: matches in titles
    come before matches in full text, and object results are better categorized.
    Also implement a pluggable search scorer.
  - #1053: The "rightsidebar" and "collapsiblesidebar" HTML theme options now work
    together.
  - Update to jQuery 1.7.1 and Underscore.js 1.3.1.

* Texinfo builder

  - An "Index" node is no longer added when there are no entries.
  - "deffn" categories are no longer capitalized if they contain capital
    letters.
  - ``desc_annotation`` nodes are now rendered.
  - ``strong`` and ``emphasis`` nodes are now formatted like
    ``literal``\s. The reason for this is because the standard Texinfo markup
    (``*strong*`` and ``_emphasis_``) resulted in confusing output due to the
    common usage of using these constructs for documenting parameter names.
  - Field lists formatting has been tweaked to better display
    "Info field lists".
  - ``system_message`` and ``problematic`` nodes are now formatted in a similar
    fashion as done by the text builder.
  - "en-dash" and "em-dash" conversion of hyphens is no longer performed in
    option directive signatures.
  - ``@ref`` is now used instead of ``@pxref`` for cross-references which
    prevents the word "see" from being added before the link (does not affect
    the Info output).
  - The ``@finalout`` command has been added for better TeX output.
  - ``transition`` nodes are now formatted using underscores ("_") instead of
    asterisks ("*").
  - The default value for the ``paragraphindent`` has been changed from 2 to 0
    meaning that paragraphs are no longer indented by default.
  - #1110: A new configuration value `texinfo_no_detailmenu` has been
    added for controlling whether a ``@detailmenu`` is added in the "Top"
    node's menu.
  - Detailed menus are no longer created except for the "Top" node.
  - Fixed an issue where duplicate domain indices would result in invalid
    output.

* LaTeX builder:

  - PR#115: Add ``'transition'`` item in `latex_elements` for
    customizing how transitions are displayed. Thanks to Jeff Klukas.
  - PR#114: The LaTeX writer now includes the "cmap" package by default. The
    ``'cmappkg'`` item in `latex_elements` can be used to control this.
    Thanks to Dmitry Shachnev.
  - The ``'fontpkg'`` item in `latex_elements` now defaults to ``''``
    when the :confval:`language` uses the Cyrillic script.  Suggested by Dmitry
    Shachnev.
  - The `latex_documents`, `texinfo_documents`, and
    `man_pages` configuration values will be set to default values based
    on the :confval:`master_doc` if not explicitly set in :file:`conf.py`.
    Previously, if these values were not set, no output would be generated by
    their respective builders.

* Internationalization:

  - Add i18n capabilities for custom templates.  For example: The Sphinx
    reference documentation in doc directory provides a ``sphinx.pot`` file with
    message strings from ``doc/_templates/*.html`` when using ``make gettext``.

  - PR#61,#703: Add support for non-ASCII filename handling.

* Other builders:

  - Added the Docutils-native XML and pseudo-XML builders.  See
    :class:`XMLBuilder` and :class:`PseudoXMLBuilder`.
  - PR#45: The linkcheck builder now checks ``#anchor``\ s for existence.
  - PR#123, #1106: Add `epub_use_index` configuration value.  If
    provided, it will be used instead of `html_use_index` for epub
    builder.
  - PR#126: Add `epub_tocscope` configuration value. The setting
    controls the generation of the epub toc. The user can now also include
    hidden toc entries.
  - PR#112: Add `epub_show_urls` configuration value.

* Extensions:

  - PR#52: ``special_members`` flag to autodoc now behaves like ``members``.
  - PR#47: Added :mod:`sphinx.ext.linkcode` extension.
  - PR#25: In inheritance diagrams, the first line of the class docstring
    is now the tooltip for the class.

* Command-line interfaces:

  - PR#75: Added ``--follow-links`` option to sphinx-apidoc.
  - #869: sphinx-build now has the option ``-T`` for printing the full
    traceback after an unhandled exception.
  - sphinx-build now supports the standard ``--help`` and ``--version`` options.
  - sphinx-build now provides more specific error messages when called with
    invalid options or arguments.
  - sphinx-build now has a verbose option ``-v`` which can be repeated for
    greater effect.  A single occurrence provides a slightly more verbose output
    than normal.  Two or more occurrences of this option provides more detailed
    output which may be useful for debugging.

* Locales:

  - PR#74: Fix some Russian translation.
  - PR#54: Added Norwegian bokmaal translation.
  - PR#35: Added Slovak translation.
  - PR#28: Added Hungarian translation.
  - #1113: Add Hebrew locale.
  - #1097: Add Basque locale.
  - #1037: Fix typos in Polish translation. Thanks to Jakub Wilk.
  - #1012: Update Estonian translation.

* Optimizations:

  - Speed up building the search index by caching the results of the word
    stemming routines.  Saves about 20 seconds when building the Python
    documentation.
  - PR#108: Add experimental support for parallel building with a new
    :option:`sphinx-build -j` option.

Release 1.0 (Jul 23, 2010)
==========================

Incompatible changes
--------------------

* Support for domains has been added.  A domain is a collection of
  directives and roles that all describe objects belonging together,
  e.g. elements of a programming language.  A few builtin domains are
  provided:

  - Python
  - C
  - C++
  - JavaScript
  - reStructuredText

* The old markup for defining and linking to C directives is now
  deprecated.  It will not work anymore in future versions without
  activating the :mod:`~sphinx.ext.oldcmarkup` extension; in Sphinx
  1.0, it is activated by default.

* Removed support for old dependency versions; requirements are now:

  - docutils >= 0.5
  - Jinja2   >= 2.2

* Removed deprecated elements:

  - ``exclude_dirs`` config value
  - ``sphinx.builder`` module

Features added
--------------

* General:

  - Added a "nitpicky" mode that emits warnings for all missing
    references.  It is activated by the :option:`sphinx-build -n` command-line switch
    or the `nitpicky` config value.
  - Added ``latexpdf`` target in quickstart Makefile.

* Markup:

  - The `menuselection` and `guilabel` roles now
    support ampersand accelerators.
  - New more compact doc field syntax is now recognized: ``:param type
    name: description``.
  - Added ``tab-width`` option to `literalinclude` directive.
  - Added ``titlesonly`` option to :rst:dir:`toctree` directive.
  - Added the ``prepend`` and ``append`` options to the
    `literalinclude` directive.
  - #284: All docinfo metadata is now put into the document metadata, not
    just the author.
  - The `ref` role can now also reference tables by caption.
  - The :dudir:`include` directive now supports absolute paths, which
    are interpreted as relative to the source directory.
  - In the Python domain, references like ``:func:`.name``` now look for
    matching names with any prefix if no direct match is found.

* Configuration:

  - Added `rst_prolog` config value.
  - Added `html_secnumber_suffix` config value to control
    section numbering format.
  - Added `html_compact_lists` config value to control
    docutils' compact lists feature.
  - The `html_sidebars` config value can now contain patterns
    as keys, and the values can be lists that explicitly select which
    sidebar templates should be rendered.  That means that the builtin
    sidebar contents can be included only selectively.
  - `html_static_path` can now contain single file entries.
  - The new universal config value `exclude_patterns` makes the
    old ``unused_docs``, ``exclude_trees`` and
    ``exclude_dirnames`` obsolete.
  - Added `html_output_encoding` config value.
  - Added the `latex_docclass` config value and made the
    "twoside" documentclass option overridable by "oneside".
  - Added the `trim_doctest_flags` config value, which is true
    by default.
  - Added `html_show_copyright` config value.
  - Added `latex_show_pagerefs` and `latex_show_urls`
    config values.
  - The behavior of `html_file_suffix` changed slightly: the
    empty string now means "no suffix" instead of "default suffix", use
    ``None`` for "default suffix".

* New builders:

  - Added a builder for the Epub format.
  - Added a builder for manual pages.
  - Added a single-file HTML builder.

* HTML output:

  - Inline roles now get a CSS class with their name, allowing styles to
    customize their appearance.  Domain-specific roles get two classes,
    ``domain`` and ``domain-rolename``.
  - References now get the class ``internal`` if they are internal to
    the whole project, as opposed to internal to the current page.
  - External references can be styled differently with the new
    ``externalrefs`` theme option for the default theme.
  - In the default theme, the sidebar can experimentally now be made
    collapsible using the new ``collapsiblesidebar`` theme option.
  - #129: Toctrees are now wrapped in a ``div`` tag with class
    ``toctree-wrapper`` in HTML output.
  - The :data:`toctree` callable in templates now has a ``maxdepth``
    keyword argument to control the depth of the generated tree.
  - The :data:`toctree` callable in templates now accepts a
    ``titles_only`` keyword argument.
  - Added ``htmltitle`` block in layout template.
  - In the JavaScript search, allow searching for object names including
    the module name, like ``sys.argv``.
  - Added new theme ``haiku``, inspired by the Haiku OS user guide.
  - Added new theme ``nature``.
  - Added new theme ``agogo``, created by Andi Albrecht.
  - Added new theme ``scrolls``, created by Armin Ronacher.
